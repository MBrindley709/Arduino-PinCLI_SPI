PinCLI TODO list, February 2021
- Use structures for command information instead of separate arrays.
- Add echo() macro or other method to allow turning enabling/disabling echoing the received character back to the sender.
   - Maybe a command for brief versus verbose mode?
- Add #defines for options
   - Simple editing (backspace)
   - echo received character
   - 
- Maybe add an option for more complicated line editing?  History and moving back and forth in the line without erasing.
- Comments (single line or to end of line) so files of commands can be commented.
- Reuse argument string buffer so only 1 is needed.
- Change to Arduino standard line ending (CR LF)?
- Throw out initial spaces?
- Going to need binary mode
- Implement early drop out searching of alphabetized lists.
- Implement more error checking on commands and arguments
- Implement ADC setup and conversions.
